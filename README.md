# Simple Asteroids (ü™ê) Game

A basic asteroids game where:
- A **player** (represented by a triangle) can move and shoot.
- **Random asteroids** spawn and move around the screen.
- Shooting an asteroid **destroys** it. If the asteroid is larger than the smallest size, it **splits into smaller asteroids**.

## Requirements
- Python 3 installed on the system.

## Usage
```bash
python3 main.py [PathToFile]

## Possible Future Improvements

- Add a **scoring system**
- Implement **multiple lives** and **respawning**
- Add an **explosion effect** for destroyed asteroids
- Add **acceleration** to player movement
- Make all objects **wrap around** the screen instead of disappearing
- Add a **background image**
- Create **different weapon types**
- Make asteroids **lumpy** instead of perfectly round
- Give the ship a **triangular hitbox** instead of a circular one
- Add a **shield power-up**
- Add a **speed power-up**
- Add **bombs** that the player can drop
